# sample_go_cli
testing go cli repo 

This is a simple GO CLI tool resembling PRP-like structure 

This repo has two build config files

build_cli.yaml for building the code, storing the build file 

run_binary.yaml for running the build binary 

Here we are testing "prp check product arg[0] arg[1] "
command 


I made separate triggers for both the config files in cloud build
